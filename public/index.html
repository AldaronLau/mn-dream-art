    <h1>MNdreamArt</h1>
    <p>
    Acrylic Landscape/Nature paintings. You can choose one I made or I can make
    you a special one with your favorite colors and subject. I also paint
    objects like rain barrels, lawn chairs, flower pots, canvas bags, wooden
    boxes, glass candles, ornaments, all sizes of canvas... just about anything
    indoor or outdoors with acrylic paints. Everything is original, hand painted
    by me for you, no prints.
